    <h2>Rock band</h2>
    <div>
        <p1>Two years ago, our 14-year-old-son, Ben, asked us for a set of drums for his birthday.
            At first, we were very much against the idea because of the noise. “It’s better than watching television or playing
            computer games in my free time”, Ben argued, “and it’ll keep me out of trouble”. In the end we gave in.
            “All right”, we said, “but you must consider the rest of the family and the neighbours when you play”.
            That was just the beginning. Because drums are not the easiest instruments to transport,
            the other members of Ben’s band started appearing at our home with their guitars and other electrical equipment.
            And so, for several hours a week, the house shakes to the noise of their instruments and their teenage singing.
