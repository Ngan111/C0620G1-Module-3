            Two years ago, our 14-year-old-son, Ben, asked us for a set of drums for his birthday.
            At first, we were very much against the idea because of the noise. “It’s better than watching television
            or playing computer games in my free time”, Ben argued, “and it’ll keep me out of trouble”.
            In the end we gave in. “All right”, we said, “but you must consider the rest of the family and
            the neighbours when you play”.
        </p>
        <p id = "boxModel2">
            That was just the beginning. Because drums are not the easiest instruments to transport, the other members
            of Ben’s band started appearing at our home with their guitars and other electrical equipment. And so, for
            several hours a week, the house shakes to the noise of their instruments and their teenage singing.
        </p>

            At least Ben’s hobby has been good for our health: Whenever the band start practising, my husband and I go out
            for a long walk. And I must admit that, although their music may sound a little strange, they are friendly and
            polite group of young men.
